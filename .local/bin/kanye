# @description When called, returns a Kanye West quote via https://kanye.rest.
# @requires curl, jq, tr

# 1. Uses cURL to make a request to kanye.rest
# 2. Trims the response down to just the `quote`.
# 3. Removes any double-quotes in the response.
make_request () {
  # I could just use ?format=text here and make this program a lot simpler. However, that causes a weird line-ending character on my system.
  # That character is a "%" with a white background. If you think you know what's causing that let me know. (I use ZSH)
  curl api.kanye.rest -s | jq '.quote' | tr -d '"'
}

log_version () {
  echo 'kanye.sh 0.1.0'
}

# @todo implement
pad_request () {}

print_help () {
  cat <<eof
  usage: kanye [-hvp]

  flags:
    -p: Dictates whether the quote will be padded
    -h: Prints program usage information
    -v: Prints program version
