# When called this function does the following:

# 1. Uses cURL to make a request to kanye.rest
# 2. Trims the response down to just the `quote`.
# 3. Removes any double-quotes in the response.
make_request () {
  # I could just use ?format=text here and make this program a lot simpler. However, that causes a weird line-ending character on my system.
  # That character is a "%" with a white background. If you think you know what's causing that let me know. (I use ZSH)
