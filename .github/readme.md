Welcome to my `$HOME`, please come in. Dotfiles are your systems configuration files &mdash; these are mine. This repository holds most of the configuration files for my system.

At the moment there's no bootstrap script to install required programs. I'm working on creating one.

### Editor

My current editor is VS Code. It doesn't support configuration via file, so instead I use Shan Khan's Settings Sync extension.

So to get my configurations follow these instructions:

1. Create a copy of my [settings gist](https://gist.github.com/324Luke/39fde10578be53782788aeccea116f55).
2. Install the extension via this [url](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync).
3. Restart VS Code
4. You should see a screen with an option to "Login with Github"
   1. After clicking this a window should open in your browser. Follow the instructions until you see a confirmation.
5. If you copied the gist correctly a menu will open with a list of gists will appear, select the one containing my settings.
