# üêª dotfiles

Welcome to my `$HOME`, please come in.

I use [`yadm`](https://yadm.io) to manage these files.

## installation

Install yadm (On Arch, it's `sudo pacman -Syu yadm-git`), then `yadm clone https://github.com/324Luke/dotfiles.git`

### note about `.dir_colors`

I use the nord theme dir colors, If you'd like to install them yourself you'll have to see [@arcticicestudio/nord-dircolors](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord-dircolors).
